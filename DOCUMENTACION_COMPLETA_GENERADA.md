### 📄 Archivo: `.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pip/_internal/resolution/resolvelib/provider.py`
# Notes on the relationship between the provider, the factory, and the
# candidate and requirement classes.
#
# The provider is a direct implementation of the resolvelib class. Its role
# is to deliver the API that resolvelib expects.
#
# Rather than work with completely abstract "requirement" and "candidate"
# concepts as resolvelib does, pip has concrete classes implementing these two
# ideas. The API of Requirement and Candidate objects are defined in the base
# classes, but essentially map fairly directly to the equivalent provider
# methods. In particular, `find_matches` and `is_satisfied_by` are
# requirement methods, and `get_dependencies` is a candidate method.
#
# The factory is the interface to pip's internal mechanisms. It is stateless,
# and is created by the resolver and held as a property of the provider. It is
# responsible for creating Requirement and Candidate objects, and provides
# services to those objects (access to pip's finder and preparer).

# Python's sort is stable so using a binary key function keeps relative order

# The following comments and HTTP headers were originally added by
# Donald Stufft in git commit 22c562429a61bb77172039e480873fb239dd8c03.
#
# We use Accept-Encoding: identity here because requests defaults to
# accepting compressed responses. This breaks in a variety of ways
# depending on how the server is configured.
# - Some servers will notice that the file isn't a compressible file
#   and will leave the file alone and with an empty Content-Encoding
# - Some servers will notice that the file is already compressed and
#   will leave the file alone, adding a Content-Encoding: gzip header
# - Some servers won't notice anything at all and will take a file
#   that's already been compressed and compress it again, and set
#   the Content-Encoding: gzip header
# By setting this to request only the identity encoding we're hoping
# to eliminate the third case.  Hopefully there does not exist a server
# which when given a file will notice it is already compressed and that
# you're not asking for a compressed file and will then decompress it
# before sending because if that's the case I don't think it'll ever be
# possible to make this work.

# each token type defined in the current style.  That obviously is
# problematic if the highlighted code is produced for a different style
# than the style commands themselves.
#
# This version works much like the HTML formatter which assigns multiple
# CSS classes to each <span> tag, from the most specific to the least
# specific token type, thus falling back to the parent token type if one
# is not defined.  Here, the classes are there too and use the same short
# forms given in token.STANDARD_TYPES.
#
# Highlighted code now only uses one custom command, which by default is
# \PY and selectable by the commandprefix option (and in addition the
# escapes \PYZat, \PYZlb and \PYZrb which haven't been renamed for
# backwards compatibility purposes).
#
# \PY has two arguments: the classes, separated by +, and the text to
# render in that style.  The classes are resolved into the respective
# style commands by magic, which serves to ignore unknown classes.
#
# The magic macros are:
# * \PY@it, \PY@bf, etc. are unconditionally wrapped around the text
#   to render in \PY@do.  Their definition determines the style.
# * \PY@reset resets \PY@it etc. to do nothing.
# * \PY@toks parses the list of classes, using magic inspired by the
#   keyval package (but modified to use plusses instead of commas
#   because fancyvrb redefines commas inside its environments).
# * \PY@tok processes one class, calling the \PY@tok@classname command
#   if it exists.
# * \PY@tok@classname sets the \PY@it etc. to reflect the chosen style
#   for its class.
# * \PY resets the style, parses the classnames and then calls \PY@do.
#
# Tip: to read this code, print it out in substituted form using e.g.
# >>> print STYLE_TEMPLATE % {'cp': 'PY'}

### 📄 Archivo: `.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pip/_vendor/urllib3/util/wait.py`
# How should we wait on sockets?
#
# There are two types of APIs you can use for waiting on sockets: the fancy
# modern stateful APIs like epoll/kqueue, and the older stateless APIs like
# select/poll. The stateful APIs are more efficient when you have a lots of
# sockets to keep track of, because you can set them up once and then use them
# lots of times. But we only ever want to wait on a single socket at a time
# and don't want to keep track of state, so the stateless APIs are actually
# more efficient. So we want to use select() or poll().
#
# Now, how do we choose between select() and poll()? On traditional Unixes,
# select() has a strange calling convention that makes it slow, or fail
# altogether, for high-numbered file descriptors. The point of poll() is to fix
# that, so on Unixes, we prefer poll().
#
# On Windows, there is no poll() (or at least Python doesn't provide a wrapper
# for it), but that's OK, because on Windows, select() doesn't have this
# strange calling convention; plain select() works fine.
#
# So: on Windows we use select(), and everywhere else we use poll(). We also
# fall back to select() in case poll() is somehow broken or missing.

### 📄 Archivo: `.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/urllib3/util/wait.py`
# How should we wait on sockets?
#
# There are two types of APIs you can use for waiting on sockets: the fancy
# modern stateful APIs like epoll/kqueue, and the older stateless APIs like
# select/poll. The stateful APIs are more efficient when you have a lots of
# sockets to keep track of, because you can set them up once and then use them
# lots of times. But we only ever want to wait on a single socket at a time
# and don't want to keep track of state, so the stateless APIs are actually
# more efficient. So we want to use select() or poll().
#
# Now, how do we choose between select() and poll()? On traditional Unixes,
# select() has a strange calling convention that makes it slow, or fail
# altogether, for high-numbered file descriptors. The point of poll() is to fix
# that, so on Unixes, we prefer poll().
#
# On Windows, there is no poll() (or at least Python doesn't provide a wrapper
# for it), but that's OK, because on Windows, select() doesn't have this
# strange calling convention; plain select() works fine.
#
# So: on Windows we use select(), and everywhere else we use poll(). We also
# fall back to select() in case poll() is somehow broken or missing.
